# Ideally Apipie would use Markdown for writing things like method descriptions,
# etc.  This is great except that it is very indentation sensitive.  When we use
# multiline heredocs and interpolate indentation sensitive multiline strings into
# it (e.g. JSON schema strings derived from our Representable representers),
# things get all messed up format-wise.  So we do two things:
# 
# 1) We assume that the indentation of the first line of a heredoc is what should 
#    be removed from all lines (hence the first two lines of the 'to_html' method)
# 2) This can be a problem when we embed a multiline preformatted string (where 
#    indentation is important), so our hack is to use "funky" indentation
#    characters instead of spaces at the start of lines in that preformatted
#    code.  That way when we remove spaces from the start of lines in thw
#    preformatted block we don't mess up the intentional indentation.
#
# Sucks, I know.  If someone knows a better approach I'm all ears.

    Access to the API requires either a valid ID and secret key combination or having a user
    that is logged in to the system.  

    When communicating with the API, developers must set a header in the HTTP request to specify
    which version of the API they want to use:

    <table class='std-list-1' style='width: 80%; margin: 15px auto'>
      <tr>
        <th>Header Name</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Version Accessed</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>'Accept'</code></td>
        <td><code>'application/vnd.#{OpenstaxApi.main_app_name.downcase}.openstax.v1'</code></td>
        <td>v1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    Many of the API specifications provide a related JSON schema.  These schemas are based on the 
    standard being defined at [http://json-schema.org/](http://json-schema.org/).
